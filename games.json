Firehazard looked to the fan community for financial support via a crowdfunding campaign on the (now defunct) German Kickstarter-like platform \"pling.de\" which promised soundtracks, physical copies of the game and other goodies. While the campaign was successful, the details on the development progress were minimal and Firehazard went silent.</p><p>After many years of development trouble, the game resurfaced with a final \"all-or-nothing\"Kickstarter campaign. If it had failed, the team would have lost the rights but the campaign ended up being successful, arriving at $96,591 out of a $75,000 goal. The game that is now being developed with this money is going to be a 2D sidescrolling shooter heavily inspired by Contra. Initially, the 3DS version started development at <a href=\"/bplus/3010-6644/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6644\">BPlus Games</a>, but soon development moved to another studio. Part of the campaign's base goal were retro ports to SEGA Dreamcast and PC Engine CD/TG-16 CD. The latter were originally going to be be handled by Aetherbyte Team.</p><p>In its final pre-release stretch, the development team is officially just referred to as Team Saber Rider with PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo 3DS eShop, PC/Mac/Linux, Dreamcast, and PCEngineCD as the final release platforms. Publisher JoshProd will distribute physical copies of all versions except the 3DS

The Mongols, led by General Khotun Khan, have invaded Tsushima and slaughtered most of the samurai there with unconventional military tactics. Jin Sakai, a samurai and one of the few survivors of the initial attack, realizes that his knowledge of war is useless, and therefore must learn how to fight like a dishonorable Ghost to stop the Mongols before they reach the mainland of Japan.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Players can tackle most missions in one of two ways: as the honorable Samurai, Jin can challenge enemy leaders to duels, and use multiple forms of sword and bow combat to bring death to multiple enemies. As the dishonorable Ghost, Jin can make use of different items to distract enemies, quietly assassinate them, or even make lesser Mongols tremble in fear of his reputation.</p><p>Outside of combat, players can be guided by the wind to their objective, and by following NPCs and other creatures can find items and sidequests such as shrines or clothing

The game made by Final Strike Games, located in Bellevue, Washington, is built in association with publisher Nexon America. As such, the game is hosted both on Steam and Nexon's own launcher. Cross-platform play is also available with Xbox One and Playstation 4.</p><p>There are many influences in Rocket Arena, taking cues from games like Paladins and Super Smash Bros. Characters in the game come with both a fire and alternate fire, as well as an active ability. These tools are based on mobility, given the non-lethal nature of the game.</p><p>Rocket Arena is set in the fictional world of Crater. Players participate in the Rocket Championship Tour, in an attempt to obtain the Rocket Trophy. The competition is akin to the Olympics, where each hero represents their respective region in Crater. Every first and last event in the tour is held in the host city of the person who won the previous year. The championship is in its 98th year, with the character, Jayto, winning previously for their region of Boom City, a futuristic city built in the clouds.</p><p>The reveal trailer for Rocket Arena licenses the use of Chumbawamba's hit song, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gG-pnIaEaU\" data-target=\"true\" data-nofollow=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tubthumping</a>.\"</p><h2>Game modes</h2><p>While Rocket Arena has a main focus on a knockout mode, it is not the only thing available in-game. There are four modes known that each spin traditional systems with the game's non-lethal gameplay. Rounds are set to only last five minutes and include a matchmaking system.</p><p>Here are the four modes:</p><p><strong>- Knockout:</strong> Akin to Super Smash Bros, players try to ring-out others. Each person is given three stocks, also known as lives, which are spent when exiting the play arena. The winner is the team who can deplete the opponent team of all stocks. Unlike Super Smash Bros, however, participants without stocks can still participate in the game, like in games such as <a href=\"/bomberman/3025-67/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-67\">Bomberman</a>.</p><p><strong>- Rocketball:</strong> Teams fight over a ball and try to throw it in the opponent's goal, like the Team Fortress Push map or Lawbreakers' Blitzball mode.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/9/91548/3101440-%5Brocket%20arena%5D%20rocketball.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3101440\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/9/91548/3101440-%5Brocket%20arena%5D%20rocketball.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3101440\"><img alt=\"A stylized version of Rocket Arena's Rocketball mode.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/9/91548/3101440-%5Brocket%20arena%5D%20rocketball.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/91548/3101440-%5Brocket%20arena%5D%20rocketball.jpg 3840w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/9/91548/3101440-%5Brocket%20arena%5D%20rocketball.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/91548/3101440-%5Brocket%20arena%5D%20rocketball.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></a><figcaption>A stylized version of Rocket Arena's Rocketball mode.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>- Mega Rocket:</strong> A classic point control mode, except the capture zones are decided by the impact of large incoming rockets.

project that began in 1992 but one that is now launching on Nintendo Switch, just a tad bit later and on an entirely modern day gaming platform than originally planned.</p><p>1993 was the year that 1993 Shenandoah was supposed to be released, but teenage drama split the youthful team apart and the game never saw the light of day until some 20 years later. Fast forward to 2015 when Krister gathered a motley crew of less youthful people to convert the original game to a more modern game engine, but still only using the original graphics, sound, and effects from the Amiga production.<br /><br />Now a few years later, 1993 Shenandoah is available on the Nintendo Switch, a console that is perfect for side-scrolling shoot’em ups, and a place the game can truly call home. Back in the day games were played with joysticks and today's joypads actually work even better with the shoot’em up genre.<br /><br />4 Player Couch CO-OP<br />Up to 4 simultaneous players, exciting levels, pixel graphics from 1993 and everything needed to take you back in time, when games were sold on a floppy disc, social media wasn’t invented and people used phones for calling each

consist of a 2D grid of tiles of various kinds, as well as a goal ring.

Some tiles are lit up by stepping on them. All tiles that can be lit up must be to activate the goal ring, and then Limiter!.exe must be moved to the goal ring to complete the level.</p><p>The game's puzzles come from navigating the maps and

","description":"<p><u>Auto Fire</u> puts the player behind the wheel of a decked-out combat car in a procedurally generated post-apocalyptic open world. It uses turn-based vehicle combat in a roguelike adventure style, allowing for deep customization and tactical decisions in a flamboyant and dynamic world. As an RPG, the player will gather loot, transport cargo, take on missions for corporations, drive in convoys, compete in arena duels, and most of all build their fame.</p><p>The world of Auto Fire is not one of dust and misery, it's a place where bored citizens toil away inside walled citadels and live vicariously through reality stars. They must earn their interest by playing for the camera and fighting with flair. A roster of Rival Drivers are freelance combatants just like the player with their own name to build and choices to make, with a single <strong>arch-rival </strong>hidden within secretly plotting their demise.</p><p>The game is inspired by the classic vehicle combat games of the 80's and 90's such as Car Wars, Autoduel, and Interstate

Sooner on later, based on player choices, other players are encountered and the player is forced to deal with them, either by making friends, or by fighting.</p><p>The main goal of the game is to control the best castles in the game, for as long as the player can, as the competition can be harsh.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game contains 3 main aspects.</p><h3>City management</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/36/362882/3203339-ss1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3203339\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/36/362882/3203339-ss1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3203339\"><img alt=\"The starting town, in city view\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/36/362882/3203339-ss1.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/36/362882/3203339-ss1.png 1920w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/36/362882/3203339-ss1.png 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/36/362882/3203339-ss1.png 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/36/362882/3203339-ss1.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The starting town, in city view</figcaption></figure><p>The player can manage its city, or cities, from the city view interface.</p><p>Buildings can be constructed or upgraded, workers can be allocated and resources produced or traded.</p><p>Building construction or upgrades, as well as passive resource production happen in fixed time increments called seasons.</p><p>Recruiting soldiers, selling, buying or transferring resources happens instantly (in real time).</p><p>All armies are raised from the castle barracks.

That character has the combined attack power of all the soldiers in the group and, when hit, the damage to it is distributed to the units in the group. For the purpose of this, the units are arranged in stacks with the first unit taking as much damage as it can before being killed, then damage being distributed to the second unit in the group and so on, until the entire group is destroyed (and the character representation for it dies) or until the incoming damage is exhausted.</p><p>The goal of each player in this situation is to eliminate the opponent's characters before losing its own, by using a variety of clever tactics like overwhelming attacks, flanking attacks, spells or simply by sheer numbers.</p><p>This view is the main tactical aspect of the game.</p><h2>Career paths</h2><p>There are currently 3 main career paths, for each individual lord.</p><p>The paths are defined by the type of experience a lord gets, which in turn is decided by means it uses to dispose of its enemies. Also, it is worth mentioning that each player can have several lords, each on is own career path.</p><h3>Magic</h3><p>Magic spells damage enemy soldiers, and buffs enhance the fighting abilities of their own minions. Even if any lord can cast spells, lords that specialize in magic can master skills that enhance the use of these spells and the wizards from the commanded armies. They are not very useful on the battlefield and they rarely participate sword-in-hand in the battle. Armies under their command will appear to be small and fragile, but the spell scrolls in their bag can quickly change the tides of a battle.</p><h3>Command</h3><p>Commanding an army requires charisma and planning. Lords that specialize in command skills can enhance specific unit types (equipment types) passively, increasing efficiency. Additionally, the armies commanded by them tend to be large, with lots of troops as well as lots of soldiers in each troop. These lords can wield the most powerful armies in the game, but they also tend to suffer more losses then the other two types. Very good in the late game.</p><h3>Heroic</h3><p>Heroic lords work on enhancing their own abilities as well as the abilities of the soldiers under their command. They are fearless, resilient and deadly. They always actively participate in battles, leading their comrades. The skills they master enhance all soldiers, regardless of type, with improvements to life, armor, evasion and damage. Due to this, heroic lords are very efficient killing machines, usually suffering less losses then they incur, even if they end up losing the fight. Their elitist mentality however makes them stubborn generals, and they tend to command much smaller armies then their charismatic counterparts. Excellent path for new players and those that want to harass bigger enemies.</p><h2>Persistent world</h2><p>The world is a persistent universe that all players share. In order to protect new players, the starting island (or map) is an instance that is completely inaccessible to others. That way, the player can bide its time and choose when to venture deeper into the world.</p><p>As the player develops, other islands (or maps) which are common to all can be reached and visited by the use of portals.</p><h2>Story behind the game</h2><p>A kingdom, in the mythical past, was shattered by the death of its king. Numerous lords that used to live in harmony are now fighting to gain control of the capital city.</p><p>Starting from their remote fortresses, the lords use ancient magical devices to quickly move their armies from island to island to achieve their goal.</p><p>As they wage war, they force or sway others to swear allegiance to their cause, offering them protection and land, while demanding unquestioning loyalty.</p><h2>Early access</h2><p>The game is currently in Early Access on Steam, with many features still under development.</p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"guid":"3030-77631","id":77631,"image":{"icon_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_avatar/36/362882/3174623-bg.png","medium_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/36/362882/3174623-bg.png","screen_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_medium/36/362882/3174623-bg.png","screen_large_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_kubrick/36/362882/3174623-bg.png","small_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/36/362882/3174623-bg.png","super_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/36/362882/3174623-bg.png","thumb_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_avatar/36/362882/3174623-bg.png","tiny_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/square_mini/36/362882/3174623-bg.png","original_url":"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/36/362882/3174623-bg.png","image_tags":"All

world.","description":"<h2>Overview</h2><p>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics (known in Europe as <em>51 Worldwide Games</em> and in Japan as <em>Sekai no Asobitaizen 51</em>, which loosely translates to \"51 of the World's Pastimes Encyclopedia\") is a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">mini-game collection</a> developed by <a href=\"/ndcube-co-ltd/3010-91/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-91\">NDCube</a> and published by <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> for the <a href=\"/nintendo-switch/3045-157/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-157\">Nintendo Switch</a> on June 5, 2020.</p><p>A sequel to the 2006 Nintendo DS game <a href=\"/clubhouse-games/3030-8573/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8573\">Clubhouse Games</a> (and the original <a href=\"/daredemo-asobi-taizen/3030-75689/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-75689\">Doredemo Asobi Taizen</a>), 51 Worldwide Classics is a collection of numerous card games, board games, parlor games, and other variety of games in a casual setting. Most games can be played in multiplayer, either locally (using single-system or LAN play) or online (using the Nintendo Switch Online service).</p><p>Various games use special features of the Switch, including <a href=\"/touch-controls/3015-2256/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2256\">touch controls</a> (when the system is in handheld mode) and <a href=\"/motion-control/3015-474/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-474\">motion controls</a> (with the use of Joy-Cons, reminiscent of <a href=\"/wii-sports/3030-13328/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13328\">Wii Sports</a> and <a href=\"/wii-play/3030-9439/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9439\">Wii Play</a>). Many two-player games can be played in a \"tabletop\" setting, where the handheld console is placed directly on a flat surface and played by both players with touch controls. Similar to some mini-games in the studio's earlier <a href=\"/super-mario-party/3030-68947/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-68947\">Super Mario Party</a>, some games allow \"Mosaic Mode\", where multiple Switch handhelds can be placed together for a single <a href=\"/multi-monitor-support/3015-6433/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6433\">multi-monitor</a> display. Some mini-games are based on mini-games from other Nintendo games (such as <a href=\"/mario-party-9/3030-35578/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35578\">Mario Party 9</a>, <a href=\"/super-mario-party/3030-68947/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-68947\">Super Mario Party</a>, <a href=\"/wii-sports/3030-13328/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13328\">Wii Sports</a>, and <a href=\"/wii-play/3030-9439/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9439\">Wii Play</a>).</p><p>The game also received a free limited version as a downloadable, allowing players to play Local Play with those who own the full game. It also includes full access to four of the games (Four-in-a-Row, Dominoes, President, and Slot Cars). This version is known in North America as <em>Clubhouse Games Guest Pass</em>, in Europe as <em>51 Worldwide Games: Local Multiplayer Guest Edition</em>, and in Japan as <em>Sekai no Asobi Taizen 51: Pocket Edition</em>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Single-Player</h3><p>All games are supported in single-player, with multiplayer-only games adding <a href=\"/bots/3015-597/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-597\">AI opponents</a> (most of which have unlockable harder difficulties).</p><h3>Local Play / Online Play</h3><p>Most games (the only exceptions being Slot Card, Fishing, and all single-player games) support multi-console multiplayer, either locally via Local Play or online via Online Play.</p><h3>Same-Screen Multiplayer</h3><p>The game supports same-screen multiplayer, where multiple players can play on a single console (docked or handheld) with Joy-Cons.</p><p>For two-player multiplayer, this mode is supported on most games (the only exceptions being Dominoes, Hanafuda, Riichi Mahjong, Last Card, Texas Hold'em, President, Sevens, and all single-player games).</p><p>For three-player multiplayer, this mode is only supported on three games: Chinese Checkers, Ludo, and Blackjack.</p><p>For four-player multiplayer, this mode is only supported on two games: Ludo and Blackjack.</p><h4>Tabletop Mode</h4><p>One variation of same-screen multiplayer is a two-player \"tabletop\" mode, known in-game as \"Play With Touch\", where players can place the handheld Switch console directly on a flat surface and both players use <a href=\"/touch-controls/3015-2256/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2256\">touch controls</a>.</p><p>Most Board Games and Card Games (the exceptions being Dominoes, Hanafuda, Riichi Mahjong, Last Card, Texas Hold'em, President, and Sevens), as well as Carrom, Air Hockey, and Piano, support this mode.</p><h3>Mosaic Mode</h3><p>A unique variation of Local Play, Mosaic Mode allows certain games to be played with multiple Switch handhelds placed together on a flat surface in a single <a href=\"/multi-monitor-support/3015-6433/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6433\">multi-monitor</a> configuration.</p><p>Only three games (as well as the Piano toy) support Mosaic Mode: Fishing, Slot Cars, and Team Tanks.</p><h2>Game List</h2><p>The game includes 51 mini-games and one bonus toy (<a href=\"/piano/3055-634/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-634\">Piano</a>). Unlike the original <a href=\"/clubhouse-games/3030-8573/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8573\">Clubhouse Games</a>, they are not categorized directly and are instead grouped into similar games (such as board games and card games).

Transporting certain shapes to the Hub unlocks new tools that allow more complex shapes to be generated. These tools include:</p><ul><li>Splitters and tunnels, which allow more complex routing of conveyor belts</li><li>Cutters and stackers, which divide shapes into their sub-components or combine them together</li><li>Painters, which add colors to shapes</li><li>Color mixers, which combine primary colors into new ones</li></ul><p>Each level unlocks a new tool, and requires increasingly complex shapes to complete. Some shapes can be consumed to upgrade the speed of tools.</p><p>After completing every level, the game enters a Freeplay mode, which generates random shape requirements to continue
